## ▶️ How to Run the Program

1. Make sure Python is installed

   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

2. Run the calculator:

   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

## 🧑‍💻 Usage Example

```
📌 Simple Calculator
--------------------
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5

Results:
Addition: 15.0
Subtraction: 5.0
Multiplication: 50.0
Division: 2.0
```

---

## ⚠️ Error Handling

* Prevents **division by zero**
* Rejects **non-numeric input**
* Keeps prompting until valid input is entered

Example:

```
Enter second number: 0
Division: ❌ Error: Cannot divide by zero
```
